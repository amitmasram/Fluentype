# FluenType

This isn't a startup idea. It's not a product.  
It's just something I built out of curiosity.

Some kids in my neighbourhood were learning to type faster,
and they also wanted to improve their English.
I wondered: what if they could do both at the same time?

So I made FluenType.

It's a small app where you can practice typing while picking up English —  
words, grammar, sentence flow. Nothing fancy. Just something useful.

## Why I made this

Mostly for fun.  
Partly to help a friend.  
Also to learn while building.

That’s it.
